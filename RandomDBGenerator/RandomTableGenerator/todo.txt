TODO:
- Add commands to empty the tables.
- Test table generation with relationships.
- Relationship tables might containtain duplicates relationships.
    - if the primary key column is also belonging to a fk, then use the fk function to generate its values.
BUGFIX:
- If the fK colunm name does not match the respective pk column the generation crashes.
    - Change the type definition of FK into Map<string,List<Column * Column>> 
      to connect the referencing column with the referenced column
